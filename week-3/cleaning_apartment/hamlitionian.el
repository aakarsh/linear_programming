;;
;; Hamiltonain Path
;;
;; Definition : A hamiltonian path `P` in a graph `G` is a path which
;; visits every vertex `v \in V(G)` of the graph `G`. Such that each
;; vertex will appear in the path exactly once.
;;
;; A hamiltonian path can be expressed as a permutation of pi of
;; vertices {1,2...,n} such that
;;
;; - pi(i) = j ;; i'th position is occupied by v_j
;;
;; - {pi(i),pi(i+1)} \in G for i from {1..n-1}
;;
;; Reduction of Hamiltionian Path problem to SAT
;; 
;; Given a graph G construct a CNF R(G) such that R(G) is satisfiable
;; iff G has a hamiltonian path.
;;
;; We define the boolean variable
;;
;; x_ij - i'th position in the Hamiltonian Path is occupied by the vertex v_j from graph G
;;
;; From the properties of the Hamiltonian Path we can now construct a
;; set of contraints on x_ij which will ensure that our if and only if
;; condition is satisfied.
;;
;; 1. Each vertex j must appear at a position in the graph (AtLeastOnce)
;;
;;    x_1j + x_2j + x_3j + ... + x_nj for every vertex v_j. Thus we
;;    or(+) the fact that vertex v_j will have at least one positional
;;    variable set to true
;;
;; 2. No vertex j will appear more than once in the path (AtMostOnce)
;;
;;    for i in positions 1...n:
;;       for k in positions 1...n:
;;             if i!=j:
;;                  not(x_ij) + not(x_kj) ;; It can't be true that x_ij =1 and x_kj are both true.
;; 
;; 3. Every position i in the path must be occupied: (NoEmptyPosition)
;;
;;    for i in postions 1...n:
;;         x_i1 + x_i2 + x_i3 + x_i4 + ... + x_in
;;
;; 4. No-two nodes j and k can occupy the same position: (SimulOccupation)
;;
;;    not(x_ij) + not(x_ik) for all (j,k) That is poisiton i is held uniquely
;;
;; 5. Non-adjacent vertices j and k cannot occupy adjacent positions
;; in the path (AdjacencyPreserving)
;;
;;    not(x_ki) + not(x_{k+1}j): if (v_i,v_j) \not \in E(G)
